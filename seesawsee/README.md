wait where is the image????</br>

## Flag 

```
enc0re{4r4_m4dn33s}

```


# Creation 

take a pic with the flag and make the width and height of the image 0 

## Solution

* open with the image with any image viewer and it will show "crc" error

* write a solve script; essentially just 2 loops bruteforcing the height and width of the image
