__version__XORPKCS1_v1_5Symmetric- and asymmetric-key encryption algorithms.

Encryption algorithms transform plaintext in some way that
is dependent on a key or key pair, producing ciphertext.

Symmetric algorithms
--------------------

Encryption can easily be reversed, if (and, hopefully, only if)
one knows the same key.
In other words, sender and receiver share the same key.

The symmetric encryption modules here all support the interface described in PEP
272, "API for Block Encryption Algorithms".

If you don't know which algorithm to choose, use AES because it's
standard and has undergone a fair bit of examination.

Asymmetric algorithms
---------------------

For asymmetric algorithms, the key to be used for decryption is totally
different and cannot be derived in a feasible way from the key used
for encryption. Put differently, sender and receiver each own one half
of a key pair. The encryption key is often called ``public`` whereas
the decryption key is called ``private``.

AES `(Advanced Encryption Standard)`__ is a symmetric block cipher standardized
by NIST_ . It has a fixed data block size of 16 bytes.
Its keys can be 128, 192, or 256 bits long.

AES is very fast and secure, and it is the de facto standard for symmetric
encryption.

As an example, encryption can be done as follows:

    >>> from Crypto.Cipher import AES
    >>> from Crypto import Random
    >>>
    >>> key = b'Sixteen byte key'
    >>> iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    >>> cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
    >>> msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')

DES `(Data Encryption Standard)`__ is a symmetric block cipher standardized
by NIST_ . It has a fixed data block size of 8 bytes.
Its keys are 64 bits long, even though 8 bits were used for integrity (now they
are ignored) and do not contribute to securty.

DES is cryptographically secure, but its key length is too short by nowadays
standards and it could be brute forced with some effort.

DES should not be used for new designs. Use `AES`.

As an example, encryption can be done as follows:

    >>> from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
    >>> from Crypto import Random

    Triple DES symmetric cipher

`Triple DES`__ (or TDES or TDEA or 3DES) is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST_.
It has a fixed data block size of 8 bytes. Its keys are 128 (*Option 1*) or 192
bits (*Option 2*) long.
However, 1 out of 8 bits is used for redundancy and do not contribute to
security. The effective key length is respectively 112 or 168 bits.

TDES consists of the concatenation of 3 simple `DES` ciphers.

The plaintext is first DES encrypted with *K1*, then decrypted with *K2*,
and finally encrypted again with *K3*.  The ciphertext is decrypted in the reverse manner.

The 192 bit key is a bundle of three 64 bit independent subkeys: *K1*, *K2*, and *K3*.

The 128 bit key is split into *K1* and *K2*, whereas *K1=K3*.

It is important that all subkeys are different, otherwise TDES would degrade to
single `DES`.

TDES is cryptographically secure, even though it is neither as secure nor as fast
as `AES`.

As an example, encryption can be done as follows:

    >>> from Crypto.Cipher import DES
    >>> from Crypto import Random
    >>> from Crypto.Util import Counter
    >>>
    >>> key = b'-8B key-'
    >>> nonce = Random.new().read(DES.block_size/2)
    >>> ctr = Counter.new(DES.block_size*8/2, prefix=nonce)
    >>> cipher = DES.new(key, DES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
    >>> plaintext = b'We are no longer the knights who say ni!'
    >>> msg = nonce + cipher.encrypt(plaintext)

Hash functions take arbitrary binary strings as input, and produce a random-like output
of fixed size that is dependent on the input; it should be practically infeasible 
to derive the original input data given only the hash function's
output. In other words, the hash function is *one-way*.

It should also not be practically feasible to find a second piece of data
(a *second pre-image*) whose hash is the same as the original message
(*weak collision resistance*).

Finally, it should not be feasible to find two arbitrary messages with the
same hash (*strong collision resistance*).

The output of the hash function is called the *digest* of the input message.
In general, the security of a hash function is related to the length of the
digest. If the digest is *n* bits long, its security level is roughly comparable
to the the one offered by an *n/2* bit encryption algorithm.

Hash functions can be used simply as a integrity check, or, in
association with a public-key algorithm, can be used to implement
digital signatures.

The hashing modules here all support the interface described in `PEP
247`_ , "API for Cryptographic Hash Functions".

HMAC is a MAC defined in RFC2104_ and FIPS-198_ and constructed using
a cryptograpic hash algorithm.
It is usually named *HMAC-X*, where *X* is the hash algorithm; for
instance *HMAC-SHA1* or *HMAC-MD5*.

The strength of an HMAC depends on:

 - the strength of the hash algorithm
 - the length and entropy of the secret key

An example of possible usage is the following:

    >>> from Crypto.Hash import HMAC
    >>>
    >>> secret = b'Swordfish'
    >>> h = HMAC.new(secret)
    >>> h.update(b'Hello')
    >>> print h.hexdigest()

        This method does not change the state of the hash object.
        You can continue updating the object after calling this function.
        
        :Return: A byte string of `digest_size` bytes. It may contain non-ASCII
         characters, including null bytes.
        Continue hashing of a message by consuming the next chunk of data.
        
        Repeated calls are equivalent to a single call with the concatenation
        of all the arguments. In other words:

           >>> m.update(a); m.update(b)
           
        is equivalent to:
        
           >>> m.update(a+b)

        :Parameters:
          data : byte string
            The next chunk of the message being hashed.
        Return the **printable** digest of the message that has been hashed so far.

        This method does not change the state of the hash object.
        
        :Return: A string of 2* `digest_size` characters. It contains only
         hexadecimal ASCII digits.
        Initialize the hash object.

        :Parameters:
         hashFactory : callable
            An object that will generate the actual hash implementation.
            *hashFactory* must have a *new()* method, or must be directly
            callable.
         data : byte string
            The very first chunk of the message to hash.
            It is equivalent to an early call to `update()`.
        Return a fresh instance of the hash object.

        Unlike the `copy` method, the internal state of the object is empty.

        :Parameters:

        KDFAllOrNothingCryptographic protocols

Implements various cryptographic protocols.  (Don't expect to find
network protocols here.)

Crypto.Protocol.AllOrNothing
 Transforms a message into a set of message blocks, such that the blocks
 can be recombined to get the message back.

Crypto.Protocol.Chaffing
 Takes a set of authenticated message blocks (the wheat) and adds a number
 of randomly generated blocks (the chaff).

Crypto.Protocol.KDF
 A collection of standard key derivation functions.

:undocumented: __revision__
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/Protocol/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/Protocol/__init__.pypasswordsaltdkLenprfpreviousUhashAlgoThis file contains a collection of standard key derivation functions.

A key derivation function derives one or more secondary secret keys from
one primary secret (a master key or a pass phrase).

This is typically done to insulate the secondary keys from each other,
to avoid that leakage of a secondary key compromises the security of the
master key, or to thwart attacks on pass phrases (e.g. via rainbow tables).

:undocumented: __revision__
PBKDF2Selected hash algorithm has a too short digest (%d bytes).Derive one key from a password (or passphrase).

    This function performs key derivation according an old version of
    the PKCS#5 standard (v1.5).
    
    This algorithm is called ``PBKDF1``. Even though it is still described
    in the latest version of the PKCS#5 standard (version 2, or RFC2898),
    newer applications should use the more secure and versatile `PBKDF2` instead.

    :Parameters:
     password : string
        The secret password or pass phrase to generate the key from.
     salt : byte string
        An 8 byte string to use for better protection from dictionary attacks.
        This value does not need to be kept secret, but it should be randomly
        chosen for each derivation.
     dkLen : integer
        The length of the desired key. Default is 16 bytes, suitable for instance for `Crypto.Cipher.AES`.
     count : integer
        The number of iterations to carry out. It's recommended to use at least 1000.
     hashAlgo : module
        The hash algorithm to use, as a module or an object from the `Crypto.Hash` package.
        The digest length must be no shorter than ``dkLen``.
        The default algorithm is `SHA1`.

    :Return: A byte string of length `dkLen` that can be used as key.
    Salt is not 8 bytes long.<module Crypto.Protocol.KDF>pHashDerive one or more keys from a password (or passphrase).

    This performs key derivation according to the PKCS#5 standard (v2.0),
    by means of the ``PBKDF2`` algorithm.

    :Parameters:
     password : string
        The secret password or pass phrase to generate the key from.
     salt : string
        A string to use for better protection from dictionary attacks.
        This value does not need to be kept secret, but it should be randomly
        chosen for each derivation. It is recommended to be at least 8 bytes long.
     dkLen : integer
        The cumulative length of the desired keys. Default is 16 bytes, suitable for instance for `Crypto.Cipher.AES`.
     count : integer
        The number of iterations to carry out. It's recommended to use at least 1000.
     prf : callable
        A pseudorandom function. It must be a function that returns a pseudorandom string
        from two parameters: a secret and a salt. If not specified, HMAC-SHA1 is used.

    :Return: A byte string of length `dkLen` that can be used as key material.
        If you wanted multiple keys, just break up this string into segments of the desired length.

Public-key encryption uses two different keys, one for encryption and
one for decryption.  The encryption key can be made public, and the
decryption key is kept private.  Many public-key algorithms can also
be used to sign messages, and some can *only* be used for signatures.

RSA_ is the most widespread and used public key algorithm. Its security is
based on the difficulty of factoring large integers. The algorithm has
withstood attacks for 30 years, and it is therefore considered reasonably
secure for new designs.

The algorithm can be used for both confidentiality (encryption) and
authentication (digital signature). It is worth noting that signing and
decryption are significantly slower than verification and encryption.
The cryptograhic strength is primarily linked to the length of the modulus *n*.
In 2012, a sufficient length is deemed to be 2048 bits. For more information,
see the most recent ECRYPT_ report.

Both RSA ciphertext and RSA signature are as big as the modulus *n* (256
bytes if *n* is 2048 bit long).

This module provides facilities for generating fresh, new RSA keys, constructing
them from known components, exporting them, and importing them.

    >>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
    >>>
    >>> key = RSA.generate(2048)
    >>> f = open('mykey.pem','w')
    >>> f.write(RSA.exportKey('PEM'))
    >>> f.close()
    ...
    >>> f = open('mykey.pem','r')
    >>> key = RSA.importKey(f.read())

Even though you may choose to  directly use the methods of an RSA key object
to perform the primitive cryptographic operations (e.g. `_RSAobj.encrypt`),
it is recommended to use one of the standardized schemes instead (like
`Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_v1_5` or `Crypto.Signature.PKCS1_v1_5`).

/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/Util/__init__.pysuffixnbits too large_newLE_counternbytesinsertinitval_encodeCreate a stateful counter block function suitable for CTR encryption modes.

    Each call to the function returns the next counter block.
    Each counter block is made up by three parts::
 
      prefix || counter value || postfix

    The counter value is incremented by one at each call.

    :Parameters:
      nbits : integer
        Length of the desired counter, in bits. It must be a multiple of 8.
      prefix : byte string
        The constant prefix of the counter block. By default, no prefix is
        used.
      suffix : byte string
        The constant postfix of the counter block. By default, no suffix is
        used.
      initial_value : integer
        The initial value of the counter. Default value is 1.
      little_endian : boolean
        If True, the counter number will be encoded in little endian format.
        If False (default), in big endian format.
      allow_wraparound : boolean
        If True, the function will raise an *OverflowError* exception as soon
        as the counter wraps around. If False (default), the counter will
        simply restart from zero.
      disable_shortcut : boolean
        If True, do not make ciphers from `Crypto.Cipher` bypass the Python
        layer when invoking the counter block function.
        If False (default), bypass the Python layer.
    :Returns:
      The counter block function.
    overflownbits too small<module Crypto.Util.Counter>nbits must be a multiple of 8; got %d_newBE/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/Util/Counter.pyFast counter functions for CTR cipher modes.

CTR is a chaining mode for symmetric block encryption or decryption.
Messages are divideded into blocks, and the cipher operation takes
place on each block using the secret key and a unique *counter block*.

The most straightforward way to fulfil the uniqueness property is
to start with an initial, random *counter block* value, and increment it as
the next block is processed.

The block ciphers from `Crypto.Cipher` (when configured in *MODE_CTR* mode)
invoke a callable object (the *counter* parameter) to get the next *counter block*.
Unfortunately, the Python calling protocol leads to major performance degradations.

The counter functions instantiated by this module will be invoked directly
by the ciphers in `Crypto.Cipher`. The fact that the Python layer is bypassed
lead to more efficient (and faster) execution of CTR cipher modes.

An example of usage is the following:

    >>> from Crypto.Cipher import AES
    >>> from Crypto.Util import Counter
    >>>
    >>> pt = b' '*1000000
    >>> ctr = Counter.new(128)
    >>> cipher = AES.new(b' '*16, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=ctr)
    >>> ct = cipher.encrypt(pt)

    Couln't find prime in field. Developer: Increase field_sizegetStrongPrime(N:int, e:int, false_positive_prob:float, randfunc:callable):long
    Return a random strong N-bit prime number.
    In this context p is a strong prime if p-1 and p+1 have at
    least one large prime factor.
    N should be a multiple of 128 and > 512.

    If e is provided the returned prime p-1 will be coprime to e
    and thus suitable for RSA where e is the public exponent.

    The optional false_positive_prob is the statistical probability
    that true is returned even though it is not (pseudo-prime).
    It defaults to 1e-6 (less than 1:1000000).
    Note that the real probability of a false-positive is far less. This is
    just the mathematically provable limit.

    randfunc should take a single int parameter and return that
    many random bytes as a string.
    If randfunc is omitted, then Random.new().read is used.
    v3HAVE_DECL_MPZ_POWM_SECsize(N:long) : int
    Returns the size of the number N in bits.
    Not using mpz_powm_sec.  You should rebuild using libgmp >= 5 to avoid timing attack vulnerability.sieve_baseDeprecated.  Use getRandomInteger or getRandomNBitInteger instead.getRandomInteger(N:int, randfunc:callable):long
    Return a random number with at most N bits.

    If randfunc is omitted, then Random.new().read is used.

    This function is for internal use only and may be renamed or removed in
    the future.

In Python 2.x, strings (of type ''str'') contain binary data, including encoded
Unicode text (e.g. UTF-8).  The separate type ''unicode'' holds Unicode text.
Unicode literals are specified via the u'...' prefix.  Indexing or slicing
either type always produces a string of the same type as the original.
Data read from a file is always of '''str'' type.

In Python 3.x, strings (type ''str'') may only contain Unicode text. The u'...'
prefix and the ''unicode'' type are now redundant.  A new type (called
''bytes'') has to be used for binary data (including any particular
''encoding'' of a string).  The b'...' prefix allows one to specify a binary
literal.  Indexing or slicing a string produces another string.  Slicing a byte
string produces another byte string, but the indexing operation produces an
integer.  Data read from a file is of '''str'' type if the file was opened in
text mode, or of ''bytes'' type otherwise.

Since PyCrypto aims at supporting both Python 2.x and 3.x, the following helper
functions are used to keep the rest of the library as independent as possible
from the actual Python version.

In general, the code should always deal with binary strings, and use integers
instead of 1-byte character strings.

b(s)
    Take a text string literal (with no prefix or with u'...' prefix) and
    make a byte string.
bchr(c)
    Take an integer and make a 1-character byte string.
bord(c)
    Take the result of indexing on a byte string and make an integer.
tobytes(s)
    Take a text string, a byte string, or a sequence of character taken from
    a byte string and make a byte string.
