2. http://crypt-online.ru/en/crypts/aes/
3. enter the ciphertext and key in their respective boxes
4. it is a 256
5. deocde

CT
1.  to get the cipher they need to work on the picture.
2.  the picture links VinRat's Steam profile
3.  on the profile description they with find the encoded cypher // ill add that cipher during the event not right now lul

Key
1. Hidden bits in image
2. Goto the link
3. Key is obtained
