Deftones - Entombed



From the day you arrived
I've remained by your side
In chains, entombed.
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all I see.

On the day you arrived
I became your device
To name and soothe.
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shades and colors are all I see
Shapes of colors are all I feel.

From the day you arrive
I've stay by your side.
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shades of colors are all I see
Shapes of colors are all I feel

Placed inside, safe inside
Shades of colors are all I see
Safe inside
