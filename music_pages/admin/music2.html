Deftones - Cherry waves



A sea of waves,
We hug the same plank
Just as I had rehearsed it over in my brain
(I saw your end)

If the waves suck you in, and you drown

If like you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down. Would you? Would You?

You hang anchors over my neck
I liked it at first
But the more you you laughed, the crazier I came

And the waves suck you in, and you drown

If like you should sink down beneath
I'll swim way swim down. Would you?

Is that what you want?
You...
Well that's what you've got

Wave...after...wave...

If like you should sink down beneath, I'll swim down,
Would you?

Is that what you want?
With you
Is this what you want?
With you, you

Escape...below...</pre>
