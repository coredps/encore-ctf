Deftones - Rosemary



There's no sound
But the engine's drone
Our minds set free
To roam

Time shifting
We discover the entry
To other planes

Our minds bend
And our fingers fold
Entwined, we dream
I know

Time shifting
We discover the entry
To other planes

Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me

We slow down
As the engines stall
Our eyes catch sea
Explode

Time shifting
We discover the entry
To other planes

Time shifting
As we collide with the energy
In other worlds

Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me
We play in dreams
As we cross the space and time
Just stay with me</pre>
